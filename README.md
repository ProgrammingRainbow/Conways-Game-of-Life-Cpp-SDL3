# Conway's Game of Life (C++ - SDL3)
Conway's Game of Life is a classic cellular automaton devised by British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It's a zero-player game, meaning its evolution is determined by its initial state, with no further input from humans. Despite its simplicity, the Game of Life exhibits complex and fascinating patterns.

* If a dead cell has exactly three live neighbors, it becomes alive in the next generation.
* If a live cell has two or three live neighbors, it remains alive in the next generation.
* In all other cases, a cell dies or remains dead.

# ArchLinux instructions.
You will need to make sure SDL3, SDL3_image, and SDL3_ttf is installed.
```
